<h2> Mangrove Beach </h2>
<h7>Mangrove plants are really useful for the enviroment. Mangroves are important to people because they help stabilize Floridaâ€™s coastline
<br>
ecosystem and prevent erosion. Mangroves provide natural infrastructure and protection to nearby populated areas by preventing erosion and
<br>
absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Mangrove forests are able to withstand the currents and waves
<br>
that come. This will reduce the risk of erosion and other impacts from incoming waves.Mangroves also help nature in getting better and cleaner
<br>
air quality.</h7>
